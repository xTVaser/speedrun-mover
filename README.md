Moves speedrun.com speedruns from one leaderboard to another

Be aware that this is provided as-is and currently has some hacks tailored to our leaderboard's use-case.  

Also speedrun.com's API was having problems accepting runs with a different user, so the username is added to the runs comment and each one has to be manually updated.
